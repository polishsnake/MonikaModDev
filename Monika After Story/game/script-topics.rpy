    m "As someone who loves more than anything else to share the joy of exploring your passions..."
    m "...it pains me when people think that being good just comes naturally."
    m "That's how it is with everything, not just writing."
    m "When you try something for the first time, you're probably going to suck at it."
    m "Sometimes, when you finish, you feel really proud of it and even want to share it with everyone."
    m "But maybe after a few weeks you come back to it, and you realize it was never really any good."
    m "That happens to me all the time."
    m "It can be pretty disheartening to put so much time and effort into something, and then you realize it sucks."
    m "But that tends to happen when you're always comparing yourself to the top professionals."
    m "When you reach right for the stars, they're always gonna be out of your reach, you know?"

    m "And whenever you reach a milestone, first you look back and see how far you've gotten..."

    m "So, sometimes it can help to set the bar a little lower..."
    m "Try to find something you think is {i}pretty{/i} good, but not world-class."
    m "And you can make that your own personal goal."
    m "It's also really important to understand the scope of what you're trying to do."
    m "If you jump right into a huge project and you're still amateur, you'll never get it done."
    m "So if we're talking about writing, a novel might be too much at first."

    m "It's such a good learning experience and stepping stone."
    m "Oh, one more thing..."
    m "Writing isn't something where you just reach into your heart and something beautiful comes out."
    m "Just like drawing and painting, it's a skill in itself to learn how to express what you have inside."
    m "That means there are methods and guides and basics to it!"

    m "Once you start to get addicted, you'll always have the urge to... you know."
    m "And sometimes, even if you don't feel the urge, you'll always find yourself wanting to do so."
    m "Not to mention..."
    m "Being addicted to the feeling causes you to view the world from a perverted point of view."
    m "From what I hear, people addicted to self-pleasure often see other people of the opposite gender objectively."
    m "That alone can cause problems in more ways than one."
    m "That's why I have to keep an eye on you, [player]."

#How did she become self aware (Could possibly expand on the lore of her club president role giving her self-awareness and omniscience. ~ John)

#More writing tips

#The player is wasting their time (I don't think Monika would say this, considering her personality revolves around loving the player. ~ John)

#Look for your computer for porn, comment on what she finds (Would this even be possible? ~ John)

#What kind of girls do you like? Do you wish monika was more like that? (This seems to relate to the "archetypes" label. - Rune)

#Play a poem game with monika, she calls you out for just stringing together random words

#Comment when it's getting late. Say that the player should go to bed, say goodnight then close the game.

###Some ideas to consider:
#What she used to do in free time

#Thoughts on few of countries in real world (I mean; she has some knowledge of real world that most people don't even think about)

#What does she think would happen if the player did not start the game; she mentioned that the player "saved" her by being with
#her in topic 13

#Has she written any other poems? If anyone's good at her type of poetry, another poem from her could be a great idea, right?

#import datetime
#time_now = datetime.datetime.now().time()
#sleep = time_now.replace(hour=22, minute=30, second=00)
#if time_now >= sleep:
#    exit()

#What would she do or what would be the first thing she would do if she managed to get out of the game into the real world?
#Think of possible limitations, like having no body? (Something like this has been written)

#some other ideas i had in mind, but not sure if want to / dont know how to implement
#so i figure i'll stick them right next to the others, if you dont mind
#---

#favorite animal, not sure what to write however

#holidays, probably should be special greetings for another file though

#remind the player to use the 't' key to talk, maybe if player doesnt talk in a very long time

#her phone number, it wouldnt matter in her reality, maybe?

#disrespectful comments towards monika

#worst topic suggestion: 'memes'.

#if the player is on a laptop or battery, monika will remind to make sure to charge it, if possible?

#originally i wrote a topic "i hate you" or something similar, but i didnt like how it turned out when i finished it, so maybe another time

#i also originally wrote a topic about money, but didnt like how it came out, so probably rewrite later, me having horrible money management skills doesnt help
>>>>>>> upstream/master

#monika talking about her room and about her house?

#wanted to write about natsukis cupcakes, but didnt know how to write the end the conversation
