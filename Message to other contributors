I could use a little help, with one thing for the feature for line 2472. from file script-topics.rpy
"#Comment when it's getting late. Say that the player should go to bed, say goodnight then close the game."
The most convinient way to contact me would be on DDLC's Discord channel, else through Steam (same name on both as on GitHub and same avatar).
And by the way, could we have some kind of private chat, or something like that so we can contact each other in case we have problems?
This could increase the rate of development of the mod.
