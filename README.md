#### Adding Content
Want to add some content to MAS? Here's a list of important .RPY files the game uses.

- **script.rpy**: This is where it all begins. Handles what chapter you start on, etc.
- **script-ch30.rpy**: Script for Monika's room. Contains all the opening dialogue, events, etc.
- **script-topics.rpy**: All topics used by Monika are written here. You can add your own dialogue by checking the information below!
- **script-greetings.rpy**: Add lines for Monika to greet you when loading the game.
- **splash.rpy**: Handles the splash screens seen in-game. 

If you wish to add more dialogue to the space room, navigate to script-topics.rpy and use this template.

Example new dialogue code block:
```renpy
init 5 python:
    # List of keywords for the topic.
    for key in ['my','key','words']:
        monika_topics.setdefault(key,[])
        monika_topics[key].append('monika_example') # Identifier
    monika_random_topics.append('monika_example') # Optional. Remove if you don't want Monika to bring this up at random.

label monika_example:
    m "This is an example topic."
    m "I feel like this doesn't actually belong here..."
    m "Why would somebody just add the example template directly into the mod?"
    m "They really shouldn't be allowed to contribute to this repository anymore."
    return
```

For things more complicated than simple dialogue, consult the Ren'Py documentation available online.
